Hello Fellow is a Trello Clone with boards, lists, cards, checklists,labels and
smooth drag and drop functionality.
<br><br>
A one-page application mainly built on Backbone with the database
handled by Rails.
<br><br>
It features very deeply nested views, sortable cards and lists that presist
after refreshing, and an overridden Backbone parse method to handled nested
JSON data, which, subntantially reduce both the size and quantity of database
queries.
